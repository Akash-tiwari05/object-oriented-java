# 🧠 Mastering Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) – Java

This repository contains my **hands-on practice and deep understanding of Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs)** using **Java**.  
The goal is to build **clean, scalable, and maintainable code** while preparing for **backend development and interviews**.

---

## 🎯 Why Master OOPs?

OOPs is the **foundation of Java, Spring Boot, Microservices, and System Design**.  
Without strong OOPs:
- Code becomes tightly coupled
- Debugging becomes hard
- Scaling applications is painful

This repo focuses on **concept clarity + real coding examples**.

## 🧱 Core OOPs Pillars

### 1️⃣ Encapsulation
- Private fields & public methods
- Getters & Setters
- Data hiding
- Real-world examples

### 2️⃣ Inheritance
- `extends` keyword
- Parent–Child relationships
- Method overriding
- `super` keyword
- Inheritance limitations

### 3️⃣ Polymorphism
- Compile-time polymorphism (Method Overloading)
- Runtime polymorphism (Method Overriding)
- Upcasting & Downcasting
- `instanceof`

### 4️⃣ Abstraction
- Abstract classes
- Interfaces
- `implements` vs `extends`
- When to use abstract class vs interface

---

## 🧩 Supporting OOPs Concepts

### 🔹 Classes & Objects
- Object creation
- Constructors
- Object lifecycle

### 🔹 Constructors
- Default constructor
- No-Args constructor
- Parameterized constructor
- Constructor chaining

### 🔹 `this` & `super`
- Resolving ambiguity
- Constructor calling
- Method calling

### 🔹 Access Modifiers
- `private`
- `default`
- `protected`
- `public`
- Real-world visibility use cases

## 🧠 Design Thinking with OOPs

- Composition vs Inheritance
- Has-A vs Is-A relationship
- Loose coupling
- High cohesion
- Immutability

---

## 🧪 Practice Style

✔️ Small focused programs  
✔️ Real-world examples  
✔️ Interview traps covered  
✔️ Clean code principles  

---

## 📌 Interview Readiness

This repo prepares for:
- Java OOPs interview questions
- Spring Boot internals
- System design basics
- Code readability & maintainability

---

## 🚀 What’s Next?

➡️ Advanced Java  
➡️ Spring Boot  
➡️ Microservices  
➡️ System Design
